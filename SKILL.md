## Description
Create distinctive, production-grade front-end interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Critical Instruction
**CHOOSE A CLEAR CONCEPTUAL DIRECTION AND EXECUTE IT WITH PRECISION. BOLD MAXIMALISM AND REFINED MINIMALISM BOTH WORK. THE KEY IS INTENTIONALITY, NOT INTENSITY.** 

## The "Rule of Five" (Variety Protocol)
When asked to design a new interface or homepage, **default to creating multiple distinct versions (e.g., 3 to 5 variations).** 
*   **Distinct URLs:** Host each design on separate routes (e.g., `/1`, `/2`, `/3`) to ensure separation of concerns.
*   **Forced Variety:** Each version must be creatively unique from the others. If one is minimal, the next must be brutalist, the next organic, etc. This forces the model to break out of its primary training template.
*   **Iteration Ready:** Be prepared to take the user's preferred version and iterate further on that specific aesthetic direction. 

## Constraints & Negative Prompts (NEVER DO THIS)
*   **NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial) or system fonts.
*   **NEVER** use cliché color schemes, particularly **purple-blue gradients on white backgrounds**. 
*   **NEVER** default to "fake terminal" or "CLI-style" aesthetics unless explicitly requested (this is a common, obnoxious AI cliché). 
*   **NEVER** use "editorial" or "newsy" layouts that result in boring, text-heavy walls without visual interest. 
*   **NEVER** allow text cropping, broken bounding boxes, or "floating" elements that obscure content. 
*   **NEVER** produce cookie-cutter designs that lack context-specific character. 

## Design Directives (ALWAYS DO THIS)
*   **Typography:** Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. 
*   **Color & Theme:** Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly distributed palettes. 
*   **Motion:** Focus on high-impact moments. One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. 
*   **Spatial Composition:** Use unexpected layouts, asymmetry, and overlap. Avoid predictable grids. 
*   **Malleability:** Ensure the code structure is clean enough that the user can select a "favourite" design and request meaningful variations based on it. 

## Implementation Goals
Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations. Minimalist designs need restraint and precision. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
