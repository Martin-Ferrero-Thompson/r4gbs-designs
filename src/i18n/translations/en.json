    "heroSubtitle": "Understanding the condition behind the challenge.",
    "whatTitle": "What is Guillain-Barré Syndrome?",
    "whatDesc1": "In short, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition where your body's immune system, which is supposed to fight off germs, gets confused and starts attacking your nerves instead.",
    "whatDesc2": "It's an autoimmune issue. Think of it this way:",
    "step1": "You get a normal infection, like the flu or food poisoning.",
    "step2": "Your immune system gears up to fight it.",
    "step3": "After the infection is gone, the immune system doesn't stand down. It mistakenly identifies your own nerves as the enemy and attacks them.",
    "howTitle": "How Does It Affect the Body?",
    "howDesc1": "The nerves are like electrical cables that carry signals between your brain and the rest of your body. GBS damages the protective coating around these cables (called the myelin sheath), disrupting the signals.",
    "howDesc2": "This typically starts with tingling and weakness in the feet and hands, then spreads upward. In severe cases, it can lead to complete paralysis. The muscles simply stop receiving the messages they need to move.",
    "howDesc3": "For some, like Martin, recovery is possible. But it takes months, sometimes years, of gruelling rehabilitation. And some effects may be permanent — lingering fatigue, nerve pain, and reduced sensation that serve as constant reminders of what the body endured.",
    "treatmentTitle": "Treatment & Recovery",
    "treatmentDesc1": "There is no cure for GBS. Treatment focuses on reducing the severity of the immune attack and supporting the body through recovery. The two main treatments are:",

    "ivigDesc": "Intravenous immunoglobulin — donated antibodies that help neutralise the damaging antibodies.",
    "plasmaTitle": "Plasmapheresis",
    "plasmaDesc": "A blood filtering process to remove the harmful antibodies from the bloodstream.",

    "heroSubtitle": "Hi, I'm Martin. In 2021, Guillain-Barré Syndrome changed my life, but it didn't define it. This is my story so far...",
    "ch1Tag": "Chapter One",
    "ch1Title": "The Rider Before",
    "ch1p1": "For as long as I can remember, my life has been intertwined with the simple freedom of a bicycle. I was a long-distance cyclist, happiest when pushing my limits on the beautiful roads and mountains of the UK and Europe. Cycling was more than a hobby; it was a core part of my identity. Whether it was mountain biking over the moors, running in the forests with the dogs, or embarking on long road adventures, being outdoors fueled my energy and my mental well-being.",
    "ch1p2": "It was on one of these adventures I shared the road with a close friend and ride partner, herself living with a chronic autoimmune condition. Together, we tackled epic journeys, like riding the entire length of the Rhine from Rotterdam to its source near Andermatt in Switzerland. Cycling took me to incredible places and introduced me to amazing people.",
    "ch1p3": "It was also during this time that I reconnected with a wonderful friend in Spain, Edurne. Our friendship blossomed into a relationship, and we began dreaming of our own cycling adventures together, maybe even the Camino de Santiago. Life felt full of possibility.",
    "ch2Tag": "Chapter Two",
    "ch2Title": "The Fall",
    "ch2p1": "Inspired by a friend, I planned a major fundraising ride in the UK — a hilly 2,000 mile, self-supported route from Land's End to John O'Groats. Tragically, an accident forced me to stop early. I was gutted. But Edurne's support shone through, and our focus shifted to planning our ride together in Spain.",
    "ch2p2": "Shortly after returning home to Yorkshire, however, the first warning signs appeared. A persistent lower back pain made sleeping difficult. Then came the strange tingling, the fleeting moments of weakness in my legs. Masked by painkillers and dismissed as nothing serious, life carried on... until the day my world stopped.",
    "quoteText": "\"The day my world stopped.\"",
    "quoteDesc": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome attacked without warning, transforming a life of freedom on two wheels into a battle for the most basic movements.",
    "ch3Tag": "Chapter Three",
    "ch3Title": "The Slow Road Back",
    "ch3p1": "Recovery from GBS is not a straight line. It is a winding, uncertain path marked by small victories and frustrating setbacks. Every step regained, every pedal stroke recovered, is a triumph over a condition that tried to take everything.",
    "ch3p2": "Through it all, Edurne was there — my unwavering support, my motivation, my reason to keep pushing. Together, we dreamed of something that once seemed impossible: not just riding again, but taking on one of Europe's greatest mountain challenges.",
    "ch3p3": "In October 2026, that dream becomes reality. Starting from our home in Pamplona, we will traverse the Pyrenees coast to coast — a living testament to what recovery, love, and sheer determination can achieve.",
