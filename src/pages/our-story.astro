              For as long as I can remember, my life has been intertwined with the simple freedom of a bicycle. I was a long-distance cyclist, happiest when pushing my limits on the beautiful roads and mountains of the UK and Europe. Cycling was more than a hobby; it was a core part of my identity. Whether it was mountain biking over the moors, running in the forests with the dogs, or embarking on long road adventures, being outdoors fueled my energy and my mental well-being.

              It was on one of these adventures I shared the road with a close friend and ride partner, herself living with a chronic autoimmune condition. Together, we tackled epic journeys, like riding the entire length of the Rhine from Rotterdam to its source near Andermatt in Switzerland. Cycling took me to incredible places and introduced me to amazing people.

              It was also during this time that I reconnected with a wonderful friend in Spain, Edurne. Our friendship blossomed into a relationship, and we began dreaming of our own cycling adventures together, maybe even the Camino de Santiago. Life felt full of possibility.

              Inspired by a friend, I planned a major fundraising ride in the UK — a hilly 2,000 mile, self-supported route from Land's End to John O'Groats. Tragically, an accident forced me to stop early. I was gutted. But Edurne's support shone through, and our focus shifted to planning our ride together in Spain.

              Shortly after returning home to Yorkshire, however, the first warning signs appeared. A persistent lower back pain made sleeping difficult. Then came the strange tingling, the fleeting moments of weakness in my legs. Masked by painkillers and dismissed as nothing serious, life carried on... until the day my world stopped.

              Recovery from GBS is not a straight line. It is a winding, uncertain path marked by small victories and frustrating setbacks. Every step regained, every pedal stroke recovered, is a triumph over a condition that tried to take everything.

              Through it all, Edurne was there — my unwavering support, my motivation, my reason to keep pushing. Together, we dreamed of something that once seemed impossible: not just riding again, but taking on one of Europe's greatest mountain challenges.

              In October 2026, that dream becomes reality. Starting from our home in Pamplona, we will traverse the Pyrenees coast to coast — a living testament to what recovery, love, and sheer determination can achieve.
